## Usage

Configures IAM policy to allow users to manage their own credentials and optionally enforces MFA.

Policy pulled from [AWS: Allows IAM users to manage their own credentials on the My Security Credentials page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_examples_aws_my-sec-creds-self-manage-no-mfa.html) but heavily modified.

Creates the following resources:

* IAM policy allowing users to manage their own security credentials and optionally enforces MFA.
* IAM group policy attachment for defining which IAM groups can manage their own credentials.
* IAM user policy attachment for defining which IAM users can manage their own credentials.

## Usage

```hcl
module "self_manage_credentials" {
  source = "dod-iac/self-manage-credentials/aws"

  iam_groups = ["engineers"]
  iam_users  = ["jane"]
}
```
